# Split-Ring-Resonators-Calculator
MATLAB code to calculate the resonance frequency of Hexagonal, Circular and Square SRRs
## Variables
### Circular SRR

Er = Relative Permittivity of Substrate
h = Height of the substrate in mm
GC = Gamma value for C-SRR ( A constant which varies with geometry( 2.451 for C-SRR)

rext = Radius to the outer boundaty of outer ring in mm
c = Width of metal in mm
t = Metal thickness in mm
g = Gap between splits in mm
s = Seperation between inner ring and outer ring in mm

c0 = 3*10^11; % Speed of light in mm/s
E0 = (1/36*pi)*10^-12; % Absolute Permittivity in F/mm

### Square SRR

Er = Relative Permittivity of Substrate
h = Height of the substrate in mm
GS = Gamma value for S-SRR ( A constant which varies with geometry( 2.853 for S-SRR)

aext = distance from the centre of SRR to the outer boundaty of outer square ring in mm
c = Width of metal in mm
t = Metal thickness in mm
g = Gap between splits in mm
s = Seperation between inner ring and outer ring in mm

c0 = 3*10^11; % Speed of light in mm/s
E0 = (1/36*pi)*10^-12; % Absolute Permittivity in F/mm

### Hexagonal SRR

Er = Relative Permittivity of Substrate
h = Height of the substrate in mm
GH = Gamma value for H-SRR ( A constant which varies with geometry( 2.636 for H-SRR)

aext = distance from the centre of SRR to the outer boundaty of outer hexagonal ring in mm
c = Width of metal in mm
t = Metal thickness in mm
g = Gap between splits in mm
s = Seperation between inner ring and outer ring in mm

c0 = 3*10^11; % Speed of light in mm/s
E0 = (1/36*pi)*10^-12; % Absolute Permittivity in F/mm
